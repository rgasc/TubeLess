# About
TubeLess is an Android app which allows you to add RSS feeds of your favourite YouTube channels so you can follow their latest videos without a YouTube account.

This has the following benefits. First of all, it is distraction free. There is no temptation to view related videos on YouTube and get sidetracked. It’s also fast as it only needs a URL with an XML file which is obtained and parsed in a short time. Lastly, you don’t need a YouTube/Google account anymore to subscribe to your favourite channels. All you have to do is add the URL of the channel and it will be obtained.
